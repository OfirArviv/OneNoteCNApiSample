    <p class="description">
        The OneNote Class Notebook APIs let you programmatically create and edit class notebooks.
        This sample demonstrates the basics on how you would call these APIs using JavaScript, jQuery
        and ADAL for authentication.
        For full documentation on the class notebook APIs take a look at our <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/onenote-classnotebook">article on MSDN</a>.
        We are also making the source code for this app available on <a href="https://github.com/OneNoteDev/OneNoteCNApiSample">GitHub</a>.
        To learn more about ADAL you can visit its <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js">GitHub page</a>.

                The Class Notebook APIs let you view, create, and edit OneNote class notebooks. In
                this example we retrieve all the class notebooks that you are a part of along with
                links to access them via the web client. If you'd like to create additional class
                notebooks you can use our <a href="https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook">Class Notebook app</a>.

            <h2>Teacher-only section group</h2>
            <p class="description">
                A teacher-only section group is an area of the class notebook that is not
                visible to the students. It's a great way for teachers and co-teachers can
                collaborate and share notes. Use the following form to add a teacher-only
                section group to one of your existing notebooks.
            </p>
            <select id="privateSpaceSelect" class="classNotebooksDropDown"></select>
            <a id="privateSpaceButton" class="actionButton">Submit</a>
            <div id="privateSpaceMessage"></div>

            <h2>Copy sections to the Content Library</h2>
            <p class="description">
                The copy content API enables you to share sectiongs between notebooks. You can copy
                a section from one of your notebooks into the Content Library of one of your other
                existing notebooks. This example shows how you can use the regular OneNote APIs along
                with the Class Notebook APIs to give you a lot of control over the structure of the
                notebooks you create.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                In the following form, first select the notebook that holds the
                section you want to copy. Then select the section in that notebook that you want to
                copy. Finally select the notebook you want to copy the section to. The section will
                be copied to the Content Library of the target notebook. Please note that this form
                will expose only sections on top of the notebook hierarchy, meaning that sections
                within section groups won't show up. However, you can re-write this to access any
                section within your notebook.
